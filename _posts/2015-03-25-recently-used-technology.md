  I have to admit that I'm a person curious enough to employ various technology to solve certain problems although some problems should not be mentioned publicly like viewing 1024 site with some accelerated and mobile friendly methods. As a good conclusion, I have just used PHP, JQuery, JQuery Mobile, Python, Scala. And among these codes, downloading images concurrently is a relatively tough problem especially in that PHP has no native support for multithreading. I look into this problem and with the help of php curl's multithreading capabilities, images could be cached and rendered in a more dynamic way.
